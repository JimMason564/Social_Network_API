# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

A basic social media API back-end allowing users to add friends and thoughts and react to their friends thoughts. This app utilizes MongoDB and IDB to run. As this is back-end only, this program is not deployed.

## Instructions
Open the code in VSCode or another code editing program. Open terminal and enter "NPM Install" and then "NPM Start to start the app's server. This is a back-end only program so you will need Insomnia in order to see the routes work.
